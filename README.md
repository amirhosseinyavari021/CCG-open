🎉 **What's New in Version 3.1.1 – Smart Code Compare & AI Fallback!**

This major release introduces the **Smart Code Compare** feature for both the Web and CLI, adds new platforms (**FortiGate**, **MikroTik**), and implements a resilient AI backend with fallback support for local models.

  - **✨ NEW: Smart Code Compare (Web & CLI)**: Compare two code snippets or files. The AI provides a logical difference analysis, a code quality & security review, and a suggested smart merge.
  - **✨ NEW: CLI `compare` Command**: Use `ccg compare <fileA> <fileB>` for a full AI-powered comparison directly in your terminal.
  - **✨ NEW: Platform Support**: Added full support for **FortiGate (FortiOS)** and **MikroTik (RouterOS)**.
  - **✨ NEW: Resilient AI Backend**: The server now automatically falls back to a local model (like Ollama) if the primary AI service (OpenAI) fails, ensuring higher availability.
  - **✨ NEW: CLI `update` Command**: Keep your tool up-to-date with a simple `ccg update` command.
  - **✨ NEW: CLI `feedback` Command**: Open the feedback form directly using `ccg feedback`.

✨ **Key Features**

  - **AI-Powered Generation**: Describe what you want to do and get the exact command you need, tailored to your **OS**, **Device Type** (Cisco, FortiGate), and **Knowledge Level**.
  - **Intelligent Scripting**: Turn multi-step tasks into ready-to-run scripts for PowerShell, Bash, and network devices.
  - **In-depth Analysis**: Paste any command to get a detailed explanation customized to your level of expertise.
  - **Error Debugging**: Got an error? CCG analyzes it and gives you a step-by-step solution.
  - **NEW: Smart Code Compare**: Analyze the logical differences, review quality, and get merge suggestions for any two code snippets.
  - **Cross-Platform Support**: Natively works on Windows, macOS, Linux, **Cisco**, **MikroTik**, and **FortiGate**.
  - **Multi-Language Support**: Available in both **English** and **Persian (فارسی)**.
  - **Interactive Mode (CLI)**: Directly execute generated commands, request more suggestions, or exit effortlessly.
  - **Configuration Management**: Easily manage your default settings (OS, shell, language, knowledge level) with the `config` command.
  - **Self-Update Mechanism**: Keep your tool up-to-date with a simple `ccg update` command.

🚀 **Quick Install (Recommended)**

**Administrator Privileges are typically required for global installation.**

### **For macOS / Linux**

The recommended way to install and update is with NPM:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ccg
````

*To update, run `ccg update` or re-run the install command.*

### **For Windows**

Open PowerShell as **Administrator** and run:

```powershell
npm install -g @amirhosseinyavari/ccg
```

*To update, run `ccg update` or re-run the install command.*

✅ **Tip for Users Without Admin Rights**
You can use `npx` to run CCG without a global installation:

```bash
npx @amirhosseinyavari/ccg generate "list all files"
```

After installation, open a **new terminal window** and verify by running: `ccg --help`

**⚠️ Important Note on Running Downloaded Files (Manual Install)**

If you download the executable files (`ccg-win.exe`, `ccg-macos`, `ccg-linux`) directly from the **GitHub Releases** page, your operating system might show a security warning. This happens because the application is not "Code Signed" by Apple or Microsoft.

**We assure you that this project is 100% safe.** This tool is endorsed, featured, and used by **Cando Academy (Cando.ac)**, one of the top IT training centers in the country. The full source code is also available in this repository for complete transparency.

### **How to Bypass the Security Warning?**

  * **On Windows (Windows Defender SmartScreen):**

    1.  When the blue "Windows protected your PC" dialog appears, click on **'More info'**.
    2.  A new button, **'Run anyway'**, will appear at the bottom. Click it to run the application.

  * **On macOS (Gatekeeper):**

    1.  If you get a warning that "ccg-macos cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer," go to **System Settings \> Privacy & Security**.
    2.  Scroll down, and you will see a message about "ccg-macos". Click the **'Open Anyway'** button.
    3.  *Alternatively:* **Right-click** the `ccg-macos` file, select **'Open'** from the context menu, and then click **'Open'** in the confirmation dialog.

  * **On Linux:**

    1.  You usually won't get a security warning, but you must make the file executable.
    2.  Run the following command in your terminal: `chmod +x ./ccg-linux`

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Is CCG safe and private?**
Yes. Both the web app and CLI send your prompts to the Cando server (`ccg.cando.ac`), which securely proxies the request to an upstream AI provider (like OpenAI) or a local model. **Your prompts are not stored.**

**Q2: Can I use CCG without installing it?**
Absolutely\! Visit the **web version** at [https://ccg.cando.ac/](https://ccg.cando.ac/) to use all core features instantly—no installation required.

**Q3: How do I use the new network device support?**
In the CLI, use `--os cisco`, `--os mikrotik`, or `--os fortigate`. In the web app, select them from the "Platform / OS" dropdown menu. For Cisco, you can also specify `--device <type>` (router, switch, or firewall).

**Q4: How does the Knowledge Level feature work?**
Specify your expertise (`beginner`, `intermediate`, or `expert`) using the `--level` flag in the CLI or the dropdown in the web app. The AI will adjust the complexity, explanation, and style of its response accordingly.

**Q5: What platforms does CCG support?**
CCG supports Windows (PowerShell, CMD), macOS (Bash, Zsh), Linux (Bash, Zsh), **Cisco** (CLI), **MikroTik** (CLI), and **FortiGate** (CLI).
